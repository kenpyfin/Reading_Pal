# magic_pdf is not typically installed via pip directly from PyPI.
# It's assumed to be installed from its source or a custom package.
# If you have a specific way to install magic_pdf (e.g., a git URL or a local wheel),
# you would add that here. For now, I'll leave it as a comment.
# Example if installing from a git repo:
# git+https://github.com/your-org/magic_pdf.git@main#egg=magic_pdf
# Or if it's a local package, it might be handled by your Dockerfile or setup script.
